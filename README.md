In this repository I show the dashboard created upon some SQL queries.
![dashboard](/SalesOverview.png)
The initial info is a Database created from Microsoft that can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms)
The SQLs are on the folder sql
and the resultant .csv files are on the folder csv
